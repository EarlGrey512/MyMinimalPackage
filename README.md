# mypkg2

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mypkg2 is to see the data set which is the 2016 TTS data set
for Hamilton and the function that can be repeated.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mypkg2 from my repository,
you can download the data set and attempt to reproduce the function. The
function used is finding the length of the data set like so:

``` r
length(TTS_Hamilton)
```
